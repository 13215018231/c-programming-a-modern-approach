Only one of the expressions ++i and i++ is exactly the same as (i += 1): which is it?

Firstly (i += 1) is equivalent to i = i + 1.
i = i + 1 returns the value i + 1, and as a side effect assigns i this value.

++i firstly increments i, then returns the new value of i (postfix).

i++ returns the value of i, and then sometime afterward increments i (before the next statement).

therefore using an example of 1 = 5:

(i += 1)
i = i + 1
i = 5 + 1
i = 6
return 6

++i
i = i + 1
i = 5 + 1
i = 6
return 6

i++
return 5
i = i + 1
i = 5 + 1
i = 6

(i += 1) is equivalent to ++i (postfix)
