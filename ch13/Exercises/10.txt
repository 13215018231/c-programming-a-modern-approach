The following function supposedly creates an identical copy of a string. What's wrong with
the function?

char *duplicate(const char *p)
{
    char *q;

    strcpy(q, p);
    return q;
}

Declaring q as a pointer only sets aside enough memory for a pointer variable, so it 
doesn't allocate enough space to store a string. First we need to make a character array
to store a string and then have q point to the first element in this array.
