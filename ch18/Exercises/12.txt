(a) Write a complete description of the type of the function f, assuming
    that it's declared as follows:

    int (*f(float (*)(long), char*))(double);

    f is a
    function with two arguments
        first argument being a pointer to a function with a long argument returning a float
        second argument being a pointer to char
    that returns a pointer to
    a function with one double argument
    returning an int.

(b) Give an example showing how f would be called.


    char c = 'A';
    double d = 3.5;

    float long_to_float(long n)
    {
        return (float) n / 1.0f;
    }

    int (*f(float (*fp)(long), char *p))(double d)
    {
        *p = *p * d;
        float f = fp((long)*p);
        return (int) f;
    }

    int (*fcn_ptr)(double) = f(long_to_float, &c);
    int result = fcn_ptr(d);
