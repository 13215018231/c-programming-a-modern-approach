(a) Why do the names of the "bit" macros (such as _UPPER) and the _ctype array
    begin with an underscore?

    The C standard states that any file that includes a standard header must
    not reuse the names of macros contained within it. This ties in with the
    rule that states that any macro name starting with an
    underscore followed by a capital letter is reserved for use within
    the standard library.
    These restrictions gives programmers the ability to define common words as
    macro names in their own header files (such as DIGIT, or CONTROL) as macros
    within standard headers will likely be given names preceded by an underscore
    starting with a capital letter (such as _DIGIT, or _CONTROL in ctype.h)

(b) Explain what the _ctype array will contain. Assuming that the character
    set is ASCII, show the values of the array elements at positions 9 (the
    horizontal tab character), 32 (the space character), 65 (the letter A), and
    94 (the ^ character).

    The _ctype array is an array of integers representing characters in the
    current locale that contains characteristics for each character in the
    current character set. The array shall contain a total of 384 characters,
    and can be indexed with any signed or unsigned char
    (i.e. with an index value between -128 and 255).

(c) What's the advantage of using an array to implement these macros?
    By using an array with these values, the functions and macros within ctype.h
    can be portable across different machines and different locales.
